# Tetrahedron Identity Animation

A 3D conceptual tetrahedron visualization representing four fundamental aspects of human identity.

## Concept

The animation displays a rotating 3D tetrahedron with four distinct corners, each representing a different aspect of identity:

1. **Social: Good** - Positive social behaviors and interactions
2. **Social: Bad** - Negative or antisocial behaviors  
3. **Instinctual** - Primitive, instinct-driven responses
4. **Naiveté** - Innocent, inexperienced perspectives (top corner)

## Visual Design

- **3D Geometry**: Tetrahedron with 4 vertices
- **Animation**: Smooth rotation on multiple axes over 15 seconds
- **Corner Activation**: Each corner progressively activates with:
  - Colored spheres with distinct colors for each behavioral aspect
  - Pulsing glow effects when active
  - Text labels that face the camera
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Social: Good - Bright green-cyan (#32FF96)
  - Social: Bad - Bright red (#FF4646) 
  - Instinctual - Orange (#FFB432)
  - Naiveté - Blue (#6496FF)

## Interaction

- Press `R` to record a GIF export
- Animation loops continuously every 15 seconds
- Corners activate sequentially to highlight each behavioral dimension

## Metaphor

The tetrahedron serves as a metaphor for how human identity can be viewed through different faceted perspectives, with each corner representing a fundamental aspect that influences our sense of self and personal development.
